## Story

As a developer,
I want to deploy the admin portal to production,
so that administrators can access it from anywhere.

## Notes

This story is deferred as it requires:
- Deployment platform selection (Vercel, Docker, etc.)
- Environment configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Domain and SSL configuration

The current implementation includes standalone output configuration for containerized deployment.

## Future Implementation

- Dockerfile for production builds
- Kubernetes/Docker Compose configuration
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health check endpoints
- Monitoring and logging setup
