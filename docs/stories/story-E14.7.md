## Story

As an administrator,
I want to receive real-time notifications for unlock requests,
so that I can respond quickly to pending requests.

## Notes

This story is deferred as it requires:
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events implementation
- Backend notification service
- Browser notification permissions

The current implementation uses manual refresh to check for new requests.

## Future Implementation

- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Browser push notifications
- Sound alerts for new requests
- Badge count on sidebar
