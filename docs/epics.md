## Implementation Order (Recommended)

| Order | Epic | Rationale |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Epic 1: Device Registration | Foundation for all multi-device features |
| 2 | Epic 2: Secret Mode | Quick win, client-only, extends existing notification |
| 3 | Epic 3: Map Display | Core visual feature, depends on Epic 1 |
| 4 | Epic 4: Location History | Extends map with historical data |
| 5 | Epic 5: Proximity Alerts | Requires group member locations |
| 6 | Epic 6: Geofencing + Webhooks | Most complex, requires backend webhook dispatcher |

## Notes

- All stories follow the naming convention: `story-{epic}.{story}.md`
- Story status progression: Planned → Draft → In Progress → Ready for Review → Done
- Each story must have acceptance criteria and tasks/subtasks
- Dev notes should reference PRD sections (e.g., [Source: PRD FR-6.1])
- Existing Epic 0 stories (0.1, 0.2.x, 1.x) remain for reference but are DONE
